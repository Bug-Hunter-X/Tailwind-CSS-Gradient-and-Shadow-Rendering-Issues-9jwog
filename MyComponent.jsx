```javascript
// MyComponent.jsx
import React from 'react';

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
      {/* ... content ... */}
    </div>
  );
}
```
This code uses Tailwind CSS classes for styling. However, if you encounter unexpected behavior or rendering issues, such as the gradient not appearing correctly or the shadow being distorted, it might be due to an interaction with other CSS rules or a conflict with browser-specific rendering quirks.
